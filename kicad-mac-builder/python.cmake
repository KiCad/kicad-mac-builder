# By default, Python wants to write into /Applications when you make a Framework build.
# we want to blacklist frameworkinstallapps and frameworkinstallunixtools, so we do
# frameworkinstallframework and expand it, but exclude those.
# When I did that, I did not have success.
# Then, I tried overriding it with DESTDIR, but fixup_bundle on KiCad ended up pulling in /usr/bin/python, which was wrong, so thirdly
# I patched the python source to not do the apps and unixtools, but whlie doing so, I noticed that if I 
# were to have something/Library/Frameworks in the Framework path, that it wouldn't install to /Applications, but rather into something,
# so maybe 4th times the charm?
